# Articles
I'll use this section of my profile to share interesting
articles, which explain certain either scientific or 
programming related principles and concepts in a great
fashion, so that it's easy to understand without losing
quality!

## Computer Science
This section will take on every article, which is related
to programming from a scientific or theoretical point of
view!

## Programming
This section will discuss articles, which show some 
programming principles in action, be it programming itself
or related things, such as the work with a VCS!
